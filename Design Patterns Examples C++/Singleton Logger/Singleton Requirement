Only one object to be created.
To Restrict Any other program to create another instance.
  - Make constructor private.
  - Make copy constructor private.
  - Make =operator overloading private.
  - Have a seprate interface for clients to create instance which should return pointer to the ONLY object created.
  - The interface should be a static member ,so that objects of class Need Not be created for using the interface.
