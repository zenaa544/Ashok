Basic Understanding

Explain the difference between a process and a thread.
What happens when a process calls fork()? What is copied/shared?
Advanced Scenarios

How would you implement a daemon process in Unix/Linux?
What are zombie and orphan processes? How are they handled in Linux?
Describe the lifecycle and state transitions of a process.
What is the role of the process table in the Linux kernel? What does it contain?
Troubleshooting/Debugging

How would you detect and avoid zombie processes when writing server code?
A parent process terminates before its children. What happens to the child processes?
Why might you see a lot of zombies on a system? How do you fix it?
Signals

Describe how signals are delivered and handled in Unix/Linux.
What happens if you send SIGKILL to a process? Can it be caught or ignored?
How would you safely handle SIGCHLD in a multi-threaded application?
IPC and Resource Management

Compare the use of shared memory vs. sockets for IPC.
How does the kernel handle resource cleanup on process exit?
Performance and Scalability

Explain how context switching affects performance.
What are the implications of creating thousands of processes vs. threads?
System Calls & Implementation

What system calls are involved in process creation and execution?
How would you implement a process pool in C or Go?
Explain how exec() family of system calls work and how they relate to fork().
Special Cases

How can you change the priority (nice value) of a running process? What effect does this have?
Describe how process groups and sessions are used in job control.
Security

How is process privilege and security handled? What are setuid processes?
