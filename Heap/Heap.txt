Heap:

1- Array Representation of binary tree

 a b c d e f g
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
              a
             /  \
            b    c
           / \   / \
          d   e  f  g

for 1 based indexing
parent index=i
left child = 2*i
right child =2*i+1


for 0 based indexing
parent =i
left child = 2*i+1;
right child =2*i+2;

2-Complete binary tree : 

Elements are filled level by level
Left elements are filled before right.

Height of complete binary tree = logN

3- Heap is a complete binary tree.

Max Heap:

 Child elements are smaller than the parent
 OR
 parent element is greater than or eqaul to all descendants.
 root is the largest.

Min Heap: 
  Child elements are greater than the parent
  OR
  parent element is smaller than or equal to all descendants.
          
Insertion logN:
Element would be add at the last position available, in last level. then adjusted backwords/towards the root depending on the value till root;

Deletion:
Only Root most element is deleted .

To delete the root, first get the last element, delete the last node
Replace the root value with last element value.
Then adjust the lement to proper position from root top leaves.

Heap Sort:
  Create Heap
  Delete all elements from array ,store them at indices from last;
  (elements adjusted from leaf towards root)

Heapify: Bottom Up
  Check elements in level order but in reverse order, check if its a heap i.e if its children are smaller than itself(max heap) / greater than itself(min heap)
  swap the element with its child and call heapify for the child.
   If an array is given traverse the array from right to left and check if each index satisfy property of heap if not adjust.

Properties of a Heap (Binary Heap)
A Heap is a complete binary tree that follows the heap property.

1️⃣ Heap Property
Max Heap: The parent node is greater than or equal to its children.
Min Heap: The parent node is smaller than or equal to its children.
2️⃣ Complete Binary Tree
A heap is a complete binary tree, meaning all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level.
The last level is filled from left to right.
3️⃣ Heap Height
The height of a heap with n elements is O(log n).
Since it's a binary tree, every level has at most 2ᵢ nodes.
4️⃣ Representation in an Array
A heap is typically stored in an array without using pointers.

For a node at index i:

Left Child → 2 * i + 1
Right Child → 2 * i + 2
Parent → (i - 1) / 2
