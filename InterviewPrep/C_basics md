| Preprocessing  | cpp  | file.c  | file.i      | Expands macros, processes `#include` and conditionals, removes comments and directives |
| Compilation    | cc1  | file.i  | file.s      | Converts preprocessed C code to assembly code for the target machine                   |
| Assembly       | as   | file.s  | file.o      | Translates assembly code into machine code and produces an object file                 |
| Linking        | ld   | file.o  | a.out/exe   | Combines object files and libraries, resolves addresses/symbols, creates executable    |
