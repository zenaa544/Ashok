üîë What is a Cryptographic Primitive?

A cryptographic primitive is a basic building block ‚Äî a low-level algorithm or function with well-defined mathematical properties, used to construct higher-level cryptographic protocols and systems.

Think of them like LEGO bricks üß±:

Each primitive does something small but precise (e.g., hashing, encrypting a block).

On their own, they don‚Äôt solve big problems like ‚Äúsecure communication.‚Äù

When combined in the right way, they create protocols (TLS, VPNs, digital signatures, password storage).

üõ† Examples of Cryptographic Primitives
1. Hash Functions

e.g., SHA-256, SHA-3

Input ‚Üí fixed-size digest.

Used for integrity, digital signatures, password hashing (inside PBKDF2, bcrypt, Argon2).

2. Block Ciphers

e.g., AES, DES

Encrypt fixed-size blocks of data with a secret key.

Used as the base for many encryption modes (AES-GCM, AES-CBC).

3. Stream Ciphers

e.g., ChaCha20, RC4

Generate a pseudorandom stream (keystream) to XOR with plaintext.

4. Public-Key Primitives

RSA, Diffie‚ÄìHellman, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

Used for key exchange, encryption, signatures.

5. Message Authentication Codes (MACs)

e.g., HMAC, CMAC

Provide integrity + authenticity using a shared secret key.

6. Random Number Generators (CSPRNGs)

Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generators.

Provide unpredictable randomness for keys, nonces, salts.

‚ö° How Primitives Work Together

Alone, a primitive doesn‚Äôt solve much. But combine them:

TLS Handshake (secure web connection)

Key exchange (primitive: ECDHE).

Authentication (primitive: RSA/ECDSA signature).

Integrity (primitive: HMAC or AEAD).

Encryption (primitive: AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305).

Password Hashing

Hash primitive (SHA-256, Blowfish, BLAKE2)

Wrapped in a scheme (bcrypt, PBKDF2, Argon2) with salt + cost parameters.

Digital Signature

Hash primitive (SHA-256).

Public-key primitive (RSA/ECDSA).

üß© Analogy

Primitives = raw ingredients (flour, sugar, butter).

Schemes/Constructions = recipes (cake, cookies).

Protocols/Systems = full meals (wedding dinner, restaurant menu).

For example:

AES = primitive (block cipher).

AES-GCM = construction (AEAD encryption mode).

TLS 1.3 = protocol (secure communication using many constructions).

‚úÖ Summary

Cryptographic primitives are basic, well-studied algorithms with precise properties (hashing, encryption, key exchange, MAC, RNG).

By themselves, they‚Äôre not enough ‚Äî but when composed properly, they form secure protocols like TLS, SSH, or VPNs.
